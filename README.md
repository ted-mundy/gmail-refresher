## Refreshes Gmail. That's it.

It will refresh gmail until a new email is found. It will then make a popup (if on mac) letting you know that there is a new email to read. This is just because I don't want to open the tab.

### How to run
You'll need to sort out credentials.json, see [here.](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python)
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```python
python3 main.py
```
